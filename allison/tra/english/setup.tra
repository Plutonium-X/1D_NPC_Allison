@0    = ~Allison (One-Day NPC) v1.9~
@1    = ~Allison~
@2    = ~ALLISON has long known that she was destined to become a druid. She tells stories about her childhood dreams which feature such a life. She says that she has not had a very eventful life, but obviously the point that brings her the most pleasure is joining in your company.~
@3    = ~Upon leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, Allison returned to the solitude of the woods. There, she performed the duties of any good druid. Her life was not very exciting, barring a few incidents.

On the eve of her 178th birthday, an old friend came to her and informed her of another shadow druid uprising found within the Trademeet grove. Allison went there, defeated the new Grand Druid in ritual combat and become the new leader of the grove. Her victory would be short-lived, however. No more than a few months later, a mysterious assassin poisoned her. She perished the next morning.

According to those closest to her, the only regret that she had in her short lifespan was that she was never able to develop an emotional bond with <CHARNAME>.~
