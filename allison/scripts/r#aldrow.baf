// Allison's Drow Soundset

// This script will assign Allison's drow soundset and portrait during the time that the party is impersonating
// drow in the Underdark.  It's a bit more... provocative than her normal soundset.
//
// It will also restore her original soundset upon dispelling the drow illusion.
//
// Optionally, the player can give her the drow soundset on command.
